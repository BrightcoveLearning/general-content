    <p>Publishers often need to modify the content characteristics of their media manifests for both technical and business reasons.</p>
    
    <p>To meet these needs, Brightcove has created a framework where rules can be applied that will modify the contents of the manifest returned from Dynamic Delivery. Behaviors are defined as "if" conditions that will trigger a certain rule and a series of "then" parameters that will define how the manifest is modified.</p>
    <p>
      If you are not familiar with this feature, see the <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/en/staging/rules/using-rules-with-sdks.html">Overview: Dynamic Delivery Rules</a> document.

    <p>The behaviors, or "if" conditions, supported in the first phase include the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Explicit Request</strong> - A configuration ID that you can pass to the Playback API at runtime. This ID is mapped to configuration values that allow underlying services to make decisions leveraged by the Playback API to return the appropriate response data.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Contact you account manager to set up your configuration mappings. Then, you will be able to append the <code>config_id</code> parameter to the Playback API requests.

    <p>Rules can be applied at two levels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account</strong> - Rules that apply to all requests made to a specific customer's account
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Request Specific</strong> - Rules that are invoked on a specific request
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Rules will be applied in the order listed above. Later rules will override earlier ones.

    <h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>
    
    <p>There are a few known limitations when using Delivery Rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <!-- <li>
        <strong>CDN Providers</strong> - A customer may only have one CDN configuration from a given provider. For instance, it will be possible to switch between Akamai and Cloudfront, but not between two separate Akamai configurations.
      </li> -->
      <li>
        <strong>Media Content</strong> - Delivery Rules will not work with Smooth or pMP4 videos.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audio Only</strong> - Delivery Rules with Server-Side Ads (SSAI) enabled require both video and audio content. This is an SSAI restriction.
      </li>
    </ul>
