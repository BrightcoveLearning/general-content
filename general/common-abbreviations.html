        <dt id="api">API</dt>
        <dd><strong>application programming interface</strong> - a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability.</dd>

        <dt id="cdn">CDN</dt>
        <dd><strong>Content delivery network</strong> - geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users. CDNs came into existence in the late 1990s as a means for alleviating the performance bottlenecks of the Internet.</dd>
        <dt id="cms">CMS</dt>
        <dd><strong>content management system</strong> - computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. There are many web CMSs, such as Wordpress and Drupal, used to manage the contents of a web site, but CMSs can be used to manage any kind of content. For example, the Video Cloud media library is a CMS for media content and media assets, and that is why the main API used to manage that content is called the CMS API.</dd>

        <dt id="dash">DASH</dt>
        <dd><strong>Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP</strong> - an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high quality streaming of media content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers. Similar to Apple's HTTP Live Streaming (<a href="#hls">HLS</a>) solution, MPEG-DASH works by breaking the content into a sequence of small segments, which are served over HTTP.</dd>
        <dt id="drm">DRM</dt>
        <dd><strong>Digital rights management</strong> - tools or technological protection measures are a set of access control technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies.</dd>

        <dt id="hls">HLS</dt>
        <dd><strong>HTTP Live Streaming</strong> - an HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming communications protocol developed by Apple Inc. and released in 2009. Support for the protocol is widespread in media players, web browsers, mobile devices, and streaming media servers.</dd>
        <dt id="http">HTTP</dt>
        <dd><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> - an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model. A web browser, for example, may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting a website may be the server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.</dd>

        <dt id="mp4">MP4</dt>
        <dd><strong>MPEG-4 Part 14</strong> - a digital multimedia container format most commonly used to store video and audio, but it can also be used to store other data such as subtitles and still images. Unlike <a href="#hls">HLS</a> and <a href="#dash">DASH</a>, MP4 is delivered as a single file rather than segments, and so is often used in cases where you want viewers to be able to download the video.</dd>

      <dl>
        <dt id="rest">REST</dt>
        <dd><strong>Representational state transfer</strong> - a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Brightcove uses RESTful APIs to access various parts of the platform.</dd>
        <dt id="rtmp">RTMP</dt>
        <dd><strong>Real-Time Messaging Protocol</strong> - initially a proprietary protocol developed by Macromedia for streaming audio, video and data over the Internet, between a Flash player and a server. Macromedia is now owned by Adobe, which has released an incomplete version of the specification of the protocol for public use.</dd>
