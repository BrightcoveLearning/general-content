    <h2 id="about_ftp">About FTPS</h2>
    <p>FTP is a standard network protocol for transferring files from one computer to another. For OIS v2.5, FTPS (FTP over SSL) is required. Most operating systems support FTP natively, and you can choose from many FTP client applications. You can automate FTP uploads by writing scripts, have users bulk upload videos through a Windows, Mac, or Linux application, or have users bulk upload videos through a browser (e.g., FireFTP).</p>
    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can use any FTP client to upload videos.</div>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Account_Policy">Account Policy</h2>
    <p>Your account is limited to a maximum of 100GB on the ingestion server at any time. If you expect to upload more content, you can request a temporary increase from your Customer Success Manager or Brightcove Support.</p>

<h2 id="Getting_Ingest_Credentials">Getting Ingest Credentials</h2>

<p>You need to obtain ingest credentials in order to upload files to Ooyala via FTP. These should have been provided to you after migrating to Video Cloud. If you did not receive the necessary credentials for your users, <a href="/node/18632">contact Brightcove Support</a></p>

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you want to use manifest-based ingest, contact Ooyala to enable this functionality for your account.</div>

            <h2 id="ingestion_ftp__vr360_metadata">Setting VR 360 File Metadata</h2>
            <p>If you are uploading a VR 360 video file, first label the file as VR 360 and tell which type of VR 360 it is, monoscopic or stereoscopic. Use file metadata to transmit this information.</p>

            <p>You can set VR 360 file metadata in the manifest file (see <a class="xref" href="ingestion_fileformats.html">Manifest File Formats</a>). </p>

            <p>If you are not using a manifest file, indicate the file type by setting file metadata with the <samp>ffmpeg</samp> command-line utility. For example, suppose you are going to upload a Matroska (.mkv) file. With this type of file, you can create a custom metadata tag named <samp>vr360type</samp> and assign it one of the following values: <samp>mono</samp> or <samp>stereo_lr</samp>. For example:</p>

            <pre class="line-numbers"><code>ffmpeg -i inputFile.mkv -c copy -metadata "vr360type=mono" outputFile.mkv</code></pre>

            <p>Some file formats do not support custom metadata. For example, with MP4 files, <samp>ffmpeg</samp> allows only predefined metadata tags. As a workaround, use the general-purpose <samp>description</samp> field with predefined values to indicate the VR 360 file type. The value of <samp>description</samp> must include the text <samp>VR 360</samp> and one of the following: <samp>mono</samp> or <samp>stereo_lr</samp>. For example:</p>

            <pre class="line-numbers">f<code>fmpeg -i inputFile.mp4 -c copy -metadata "description"="VR 360 Type is mono ..."  outputFile.mp4</code></pre>

    <h2 id="Ingesting_with_an_FTPS_Client">Ingesting with an FTPS Client</h2>
    <p>You can upload a video via FTP / FTPS either with or without a manifest.</p>
    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> All upload files must comply with the ingest requirements described in <a class="xref" title="Before uploading content to Video Cloud, make sure you are using a supported file format and following the best practices for source files." href="/node/18920">Supported Ingest Formats</a></div>
    <h3>Uploading Your File(s) via FTPS (OIS v2.5)</h3>
    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> OIS v2.5 requires an FTPS client.</div>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li class="language-editable">Prepare the file(s) you want to upload.</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Launch your FTPS client program.</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Log into the ingest endpoint using the credentials (email and password) of your Video Cloud upload-only user account.</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Upload the file(s) you want to ingest (videos, thumbnails, closed caption files, and so on). If you are using a manifest file, be sure to upload all of the files that are referenced in the manifest file.</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Ooyala suggests that you upload the manifest file last.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Files are deleted right after they are all processed. Submitted files that do not go through the entire ingestion workflow (for example, awaiting the upload of the manifest file) are deleted from the server after 7 days.</p>
